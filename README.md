After you add to cart, the shopping cart icon will be green.  You can click that to view your cart and checkout.
When adding to cart the number you want to add goes in the input text field above the button. (It is hard to see at the moment).
Purchase needs to track cartid or userid or something in order to not end up purchasing all the carts for multiple users by an individual user.
